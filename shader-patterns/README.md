# Shader patterns

This folder contains Shadertoy scripts inspired by Threejs.journey L27 Shader patterns.

## Test

To test the script,

1. copy `main.glsl` content from a sub folder
2. paste the content to [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/new)
3. click ▸ to compile
4. view the player

Expected result: the player looks like the `canvas.png` in the same sub folder.
